Discard Pile:

Cards that go out of the bottom (and back in from bottom): start in visible cards and end in visible cards
Another kind of card that goes out the bottom but from the deck: ???
Cards that come in from the top: Just seems like the first 4 of the deck after the shuffle (also means first 4 of the visible after the first deal)


Possible explanation:
    * Cards that start visible and end visible, despite shortly being in the deck, don't animate back to the deck so they need somewhere else
      to go. SwiftUI just decides that somewhere else is the bottom of the screen.

Maybe we need to do the New Game procedure in 3 steps: all cards return to deck, new deck (or shuffling), dealing out cards
It's currently handled in 2 steps: all cards return to deck and shuffle, then dealing out cards

Which of these cards were scrolled off screen?


Question: When pressing "New Game", why do some cards go to a space below the deck?

Data:
* It does not happen when we combine the entire state change into one `withAnimation` block.
* It does not happen if the ScrollView is at the top when New Game is hit
    * The distance below the deck that these cards move to is proportional to the offset of the
      ScrollView
* It seems to be 2 kinds of cards that this happens to:
    1) visible cards that will also be visible after the new game deal
    2) cards from the deck that will be visible after the new game deal
* Some number of new cards appear from the top with the animation of cards returning
  to the deck - NOT the animation of cards being dealt from the deck to the play area.
    * The number of cards seems to be proportional to the ScrollView offset.
    * It always seems to be enough cards to fill an integer number of rows completely.

Theory:
    * The animation is trying to transition the cards that will be removed from the playArea to the
      deck. Since the ScrollView's size is shrinking, the animation system overshoots the distance
      it needs to move those cards to the deck.
        * But why do the cards that just need to return to the deck (not get put out to playArea
          after the deal) know how to exactly reach the deck?
    * No good theories about the first couple rows.
